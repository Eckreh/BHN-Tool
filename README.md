## Setup Python
just run start.bat it automatically creats the virtual environment (in ./venv) if it doesnt already exist.
On the first run when ./venv doesnt exist it should also install all requirements but not Python itself.
Phyton has to be in the PATH, the version used is/was 3.12.1

if it exists it drops you into a shell wihin the venv.

The IDE used is Spyder
